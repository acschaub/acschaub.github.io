I'm a psychologist and postdoctoral researcher in clinical neuroscience at the University Psychiatric Clinics (UPK) Basel.

In my research I investigate underlying mechanisms of mental disorders by using innovative approaches such as the brain-gut axis, transdiagnostic methods, and predictive coding. A main aim is to detect and develop biomarkers to improve patient stratification and enable the development of new and personalized treatments.
